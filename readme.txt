# Swift-UIKit-Sublime-Autocomplete-Package

A swift SublimeText autocomplete snippet package for the UIKit framework. Generated using [Swift To Sublime Snippet](https://github.com/hatunike/swift-api-to-snippet). For use in .swift files that have access to Foundation.

Note : the snippets were generated from the header files extracted from the swift generated versions of the header files using the xcode build tools. More on this process to come in the future.

The output.swift file is the combination of all the header files that you would see in xcode.
